## Welcome to My Portfolio

This portfolio showcases my work and projects. Below you'll find details on how you can explore, edit, and deploy my projects.

### How can I edit this code?

#### Use an IDE
You can work locally using your preferred IDE by cloning the repository and pushing your changes. These changes will be reflected in the project repository.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed. You can install them using nvm.

Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository using the project's Git URL:**
    ```bash
    git clone <GIT_URL>
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd <PROJECT_NAME>
    ```

3. **Install the necessary dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

4. **Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

#### Edit a file directly in GitHub
1. Navigate to the desired file(s).
2. Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
3. Make your changes and commit them.

## How can I deploy this project?

## I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

We don't support custom domains (yet). If you want to deploy your project under your own domain then we recommend using Netlify. Visit our docs for more details: [Custom domains](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/custom-domain/)
